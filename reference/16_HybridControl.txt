Hybrid Force/Motion Control
Prof. Alessandro De Luca

Hybrid force/motion control
n

n

we consider contacts/interactions between a robot and a stiff
environment that naturally constrains the end-effector motion
compared to an approach using the constrained/reduced robot
dynamics with (bilateral) geometric constraints, the differences are
n

n

the hybrid control law is designed in ideal conditions, but now
unconstrained directions of motion and constrained force directions
are defined in a more direct way using a task frame formalism
all non-ideal conditions (compliant surfaces, friction at the contact,
errors in contact surface orientation) are handled explicitly in the
control scheme by a geometric filtering of the measured quantities
n

n

n

only signal components that should appear in certain directions based on
the nominal task model are considered
those that should not be there are treated as disturbances to be rejected

in this way, the hybrid control law avoids to introduce conflicting
behaviors (force vs. motion control) in each task space direction!

Natural constraints
n

in ideal conditions (robot and environment are perfectly rigid,
contact is frictionless), two sets of generalized directions can be
defined in the task space
n end-effector motion (𝑣/𝜔 ) is prohibited along/around 6 − 𝑘 directions
(since the environment reacts there with forces/torques)
n reaction forces/torques (𝑓/𝜇 ) are absent along/around 𝑘 directions
(where the environment does not prevent end-effector motions)

n

n

these constraints have been called the natural constraints on
motion and force associated to the task geometry
the two sets of directions are characterized through the axes of a

Artificial constraints
n

the way task execution should be performed can be expressed
in terms of so-called artificial constraints that specify the desired
values (to be imposed by the control law)
n for the end-effector velocities (𝑣/𝜔 ) along/around 𝑘 directions
where feasible motions can occur
n for the contact forces/torques (𝑓/𝜇 ) along/around 6 − 𝑘 directions
where admissible reactions of the environment can occur

n

the two sets of directions are complementary (they cover the
6D generalized task space) and mutually orthogonal, while the
task frame can be time-varying (“moves with task progress”)

stabilization of tracking errors (on each single, input-output decoupled channel)

𝑒3 + 𝐾; H 𝑒3 𝑑𝑡 = 0

but adding an integral
with the force error
gives more robustness
to (constant) disturbances

𝑒3 = 𝜆1 − 𝜆 ⟶ 0

we need “values” for 𝑠, 𝑠̇ and 𝜆 to be
extracted from actual measurements !

“Filtering” position and force measures
𝑠 and 𝑠̇ are obtained from measures of 𝑞 and 𝑞̇ , equating the descriptions
of the end-effector pose and velocity “from the robot side” (direct and

Force control via an impedance model
n

in a force-controlled direction of the hybrid task space, when the contact
stiffness is limited (i.e., far from infinite, as assumed in the ideal case),
one may use impedance model ideas to explicitly control the contact force
n

n

let 𝑥 be the position of the robot along such a direction, 𝑥% the (constant) contact point,
𝑘' > 0 the contact (viz., sensor) stiffness, and 𝑓% > 0 the desired contact force

the impedance model is chosen then as

𝑚/ 𝑥̈ + 𝑑/ 𝑥̇ + 𝑘2 𝑥 − 𝑥1 = 𝑓1
where the force sensor measures 𝑓- = 𝑘- 𝑥 − 𝑥+ , and only 𝑚5 > 0 and
𝑑5 > 0 are free model parameters
n

after feedback linearization (𝑥̈ = 𝑎# ), the command 𝑎# is designed as

𝑎D = 1⁄𝑚/ (𝑓1 −𝑓2 ) − 𝑑/ 𝑥̇
which is a P-regulator of the desired force, with velocity damping
n

the same control law works also before the contact (𝑓- = 0), guaranteeing
a steady-state speed 𝑥̇ -- = 𝑓+ ⁄𝑑5 > 0 in the approaching phase

Sources of inconsistency

in force and velocity measurements
1. presence of friction at the contact
➜ a reaction force component appears that opposes motion in a
“free” motion direction (in case of Coulomb friction, the tangent
force intensity depends also on the applied normal force ...)

2. compliance in the robot structure and/or at the contact
➜ a (small) displacement may be present also along directions that
are nominally “constrained” by the environment
NOTE: if the environment geometry at the contact is perfectly known, the
task inconsistencies due to 1. and 2. on parameters 𝑠 and 𝜆 are already
filtered out by the pseudo-inversion of matrices 𝑇 and 𝑌

3. uncertainty on environment geometry at the contact
➜ can be reduced/eliminated by real-time estimation processes
driven by external sensors (e.g., vision ⎯but also force!)
Robotics 2

21

Estimation of an unknown surface
how difficult is to estimate the unknown profile of the environment surface,
using information from velocity and force measurements at the contact?
1. normal = nominal direction of measured force
... in the presence of contact motion with friction, the
measured force 𝑓 is slightly rotated from the actual
normal by an (unknown) angle 𝛾

2. tangent = nominal direction of measured velocity
... compliance in the robot structure (joints) and/or at
the contact may lead to a computed velocity 𝑣 having a
small component along the actual normal to the surface

3. mixed method (sensor fusion) with RLS
a. tangent direction is estimated by a recursive least
squares method from position measurements
b. friction angle is also estimated by a recursive least
squares method, using the current estimate of the
tangent direction and from force measurements
